Your site is now hosted at Netlify under a random subdomain that looks like https://something-random-40716.netlify.com. You can change this subdomain to something more desirable or configure a custom domain. Whatever you choose, make sure you enter the same value to the url variable in _config.yml file of your project, which holds the Jekyll configuration for your site. Otherwise page urls and navigations may not work properly
